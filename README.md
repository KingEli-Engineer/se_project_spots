### Overview

- Intro
- Resources
- Images
- Links

**Intro**

This project is a social media site made so all the elements are displayed correctly on different popular screen sizes.

**Resources**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

I used a few different resources including "@import" to keep things organized and efficient and "media quieries" to make the site flexible to multiple screen resolutions.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
